<h1>ELENA SOKOLOVSKAYA</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Born in Belarus, I graduated from the State Economic University in 2007 with a
  strong background in economics. Seeking new horizons, I moved to Spain to
  pursue a Master's degree in Finance and immerse myself in the Spanish language
  and culture.
</p>
<p>
  However, my true passion lay in the world of technology. Driven by my
  aspirations, in 2022 I relocated to California, where I joined Code The Dream
  - an organization that provided the perfect platform to fulfill my dreams of
  becoming an IT specialist.
